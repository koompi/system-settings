### Overview
Maintainer is a key person whose role is to organize, maintain, and overlook each KOOMPI project. When there are issues, maintainers will notify the relevant team through the Github project issue board. He/she also helps to strengthen the connection between KOOMPI and its contributors.

This paper has been created to detail all the core responsibility and process of maintainers.

### Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour
- Taking appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour
- Removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct
- To ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviours that are deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
- Communicate and notify contributors and KOOMPI team directly
- Notify the latest update of the project to everyone

### Process
To prevent everyone from stepping on each other’s toes, each maintainer must:

1. Let everyone understand the protocol, especially the contributors, before allowing them to work on the project
1. Make sure everyone is working on different properly-named branches (ideally forking the project) 
1. Check everyone’s process description to make sure everyone is on different tasks. This will help the maintainer to avoid merge conflict
1. Keep Master Branch stable. Either way, it's now protected, meaning that the contributors are not allowed to push code directly without a Pull Request.
1. Check only smaller Pull Requests in the process of clarification on PR (Pull Request). If there happens to be a big Pull Request, the maintainer will reject it immediately. 

    By having a small Pull Request, it is easier for everyone relevant to this project to follow-up with each other’s task. 

    Everyone must write a description of what they have changed in the Pull Request. 

6. Review the Pull Request by giving comments directly to the person who has  
       requested it if anything needs to be changed. Once the Pull Request is approved by 
       the maintainer, KOOMPI will review it once again.

### Proposal
The contributors can propose what they want to add to the project by talking it over with the maintainers first before they work on it. The maintainers will discuss with the team if it is necessary or not.
